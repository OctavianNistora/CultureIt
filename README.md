# MSA-Project - Culture It!

An app that allows the user to see a map with all the cultural events in the area (art galleries, special expositions in museums, Theater Plays etc.).
Its scope is to make culture more accesible to the general public by making it easy to search and find something that is liked by the user, or just see what is happening in town around the time of use.

The targeted audience is pretty general. It can be useful to tourists or to people located in that area, that are interested by cultural events. It can help the cultural life of citites as it allows for good way of promoting and gives a required boost for people who want to get more cultural events into their lifestyle.

When users open the app, they are greeted by a map with all the events. Upon clicking, they will get more details about that event)

Every cultural event has a detailed description with some characteristics being mandatory (duration, price, location, theme, interval of time and date in which the event is open, if reservation is needed and others). People can also leave reviews for the events.
